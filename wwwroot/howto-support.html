<h1>How to get suppport ?</h1>

<h2>Where asking for support ?</h2>
Please, use the forums available on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jupload/">sourceforge</a>
. It's the easiest way to check that every question has an answer. The
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=199107">help</a>
when you need help, or the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=199106">open
discussion</a>
for other threads. You'll find a text area at the end of these pages.
<br />
I'll receive a mail when any new message is sent to te sourceforge's
forums. So emailing-me won't provide you a quicker response.
<br />
And other people could also help you.

<h2>Give the debug output</h2>

If you have an error while using the applet, please send me the full
debug output. It contains also the applet and java version that you are
using.
<BR>
To do this: ctrl + right click, and select <I>debug</I>. You can then copy the whole output, and send it on the help forum.
