<h2><a name="MainChoices">Main choices</a></h2>

You can customize the behavour of this applet by using one (or more) of
the following ways (from the simplest to the most complex):
<ul>
    <li><u>Basic HTML Customization</u>. Simply precise other
    applet parameters to the applet, in the HTML APPLET tag: copy the
    sample given in the <a href="applet-basic.html">basic</a> demo. The
    parameters for all available upload policies are displayed on the
    API page for UploadPolicy.</li>
    <li><u>Using another available upload policy</u>. You can
    precise another policy amongst the available ones, by specifying a <i>uploadPolicy</i>
    parameter, like in the <a href="applet-basic-picture.html">basic
    picture mode</a> demo.</li>
    <li><u>Creating a new UploadPolicy, inheriting from an
    existing uploadpolicy</u>, like DefaultUploadPolicy or
    PictureUploadPolicy. Then, you get a default behaviour, and only
    define what is specific to your needs.</li>
    <li><u>Creating an entirely new UploadPolicy</u>. More complex:
    you need to code again every method. But then, you can use precisely
    anagewhat the kind of fils that may be upload, check them, prepare
    upload (for instance, compress file before upload), check that
    specific parameters are set before upload (the existing
    CoppermineUploadPolicy checks that an albumId is set), and much
    more...</li>
    <li><u>Changing the upload way</u>. Since 2.9.0, the
    DefaultUploadThread provides a default implementation of the
    FileUploadThread interface. It should be easy to inherit from it,
    and change the upload behaviour.</li>
    <li><u>And, of course, change code everywhere in the applet</u>
    ... like I did ;-)</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="HTMLConfiguration">Basic HTML Customization</a></h2>


A first level of customization is available by using the
DefaultUploadPolicy (that is, not provide any uploadPolicy applet
parameter), and use parameters available within the DefaultUploadPolicy,
without any Java coding: these parameters are provided in HTML, within
the APPLET tag that creates this applet. These parameters are described
<a href="#parameters">below</a>
. As there is no uploadPolicy parameter, you can only use the parameters
that are implemented in the DefaultUploadPolicy. See the column
'Implemented in' in the parameter list,
<a href="#parameters">hereafter</a>
.
<br>
The main customizations available by applet parameters are listed here:
<dir>
    <li>Control of the target URL (where files should be uploaded).</li>
    <li>Choose of an upload policy, among the available policies
    (see all classes that inherit from DefaultUploadPolicy</li>
    <li>Log information level, with debugLevel.</li>
    <li>Language control, that can be specific for the HTML page.</li>
    <li>A URL where all debug information can/should be sent when
    an error occurs (see urlToSendErrorTo).</li>
    <li>Number of files to be put in one HTTP Request (see
    nbFilesPerRequest)</li>
    <li>A string to control that upload is a success (see
    stringUploadSuccess)</li>
    <li>For pictures only: A maximum width and/or height (see
    maxPicHeight and maxPicWidth)</li>
</dir>

<h2><a name="ExistingUploadPolicy">Using another existing
UploadPolicy</a></h2>

<p>By providing the <i>uploadPolicy</i> parameter within the APPLET
tag, you can select another class that implements the UploadPolicy
interface. <a name="policies">The current implemented upload
policies are :</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>DefaultUploadPolicy</b>. It's a 'simple' instanciation
    of each UploadPolicy methods. It makes JUpload work the same way as
    the original JUpload (v1).</li>
    <li><b><i>(deprecated)</i>
    CustomizedNbFilesPerRequestUploadPolicy</b> is a DefaultUploadPolicy,
    which allows to control how many files are to be uploaded for each
    HTTP request. This class is now of no use, as the <i>nbFilesPerRequest</i>
    is now managed directly by the DefaultUploadPolicy.</li>
    <li><b>FileByFileUploadPolicy</b> is
    CustomizedNbFilesPerRequestUploadPolicy, where the number of files
    to upload for each HTTP request is ... one! This policy behaves as
    the DefaultUploadPolicy, when nbFilesPerRequest parameter (see
    below) is 1.</li>
    <li><b>PictureUploadPolicy</b> adds picture handling the the
    applet. The main functionalities are :
    <ul>
        <li>Filter: only picture files can be uploaded.</li>
        <li>Preview picture: The look of the applet changes, to
        allow display of the selected picture.</li>
        <li>Rotation: you can rotate the picture by quarter of
        turn.</li>
        <li>Resizing: the applet can resize picture before upload,
        to lower network (and time) transfer. Just specify a maximum
        width and/or height, in pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>CoppermineUploadPolicy</b> is a special
    PictureUploadPolicy: it allows upload to the nice <a
        href="http://coppermine.sourceforge.net">coppermine picture
    gallery</a>. Its main add is to manage the albumId, so that uploaded
    pictures are directly uploaded into the selected album, and to
    change the current navigator page to the album property page, so
    that the user can change comments for all uploaded pictures in one
    step.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="NewUploadPolicy">Customization by creating a new
Java Upload Policy (simple java coding)</a></h2>

<P><B>All details on the <A href="howto-new_UploadPolicy.html">new UploadPolivy HowTo</A>.</B></P> 

<p>If these customization possibilities are not enough, you can
create a new upload policy. To do this, you need to create a new java
class: the easiest way is to inherit from DefaultUploadPolicy. You can
then override methods of the UploadPolicy interface.</p>
<p>This kind of customization will be compatible within next JUpload
applet release. If you need other hooks (method within the UploadPolicy
interface, to allow other customizations), please let me know by posting a message
on the sourceforge jupload forums (open discussions for instance), or
post a new Feature Request in the jupload sourceforge project page.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the customization that you can do by
using the creating a new policy, using the UploadPolicy interface:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control files management:
    <ul>
        <li>Authorization (or not) to add a file to the list of
        files to upload, see UploadPolicy.createFileData(File). This
        allows the policy to validate files, before adding them to the
        list of files that must be displayed. The
        PictureUploadPolicy.createFileData(File) checks that the added
        files are valid pictures.</li>
        <li>File preparation before upload (for instance to resize
        a picture, or encode a text file to a specific format)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Display other buttons on the applet (or remove the default
    buttons), see UploadPolicy.createTopPanel(JButton, JButton, JButton,
    JPanel)</li>
    <li>Specific behaviour, on file selection. The
    wjhk.jupload2.policies.PictureUploadPolicy allows picture
    management. The UploadPolicy.onSelectFile(FileData) method is called
    when the user selects a file in the list. This allow the policy to
    do any action about this file. The
    PictureUploadPolicy.onSelectFile(FileData) displays a preview
    pictures on the top part of the applet.</li>
    <li>Change applet output. You can 'interfere' with some attributes (debugFile 
    and debugOK) and with the addMsgToDebugLog methods. All these are not in the UploadPolicy 
    interface, but in the DefaultUploadPolicy implementation.</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="NewFileData">Customization by creating a new
Java FileData</a></h2>

<P><B>All details on the <A href="howto-new_FileData.html">new FileData howto page</A>.</B></P> 

<P>This allows you to change the file relative behaviour. You can for instance add data compression, preload check,
new data about files in the upload to the server..</P>

 Here is the list of all parameters available in the current package, that is:
 available in available upload policies. These are applet parameters that
 should be 'given' to the applet, with <PARAM> tags, as precised below in the

 <td>This parameter allows to select a specific target frame when redirecting
 to <code>afterUploadURL</code>. The following values are possible:<br>
 <ul>
 <li><code>_self</code> - Show in the window and frame that contain the
 applet. </li>
 <li><code>_parent</code> - Show in the applet's parent frame. If the
 applet's frame has no parent frame, acts the same as <i>_self</i>.</li>
 <li><code>_top</code> - Show in the top-level frame of the applet's
 window. If the applet's frame is the top-level frame, acts the same as
 <i>_self</i>.</li>
 <li><code>_blank</code> - Show in a new, unnamed top-level window.
 <li><i>name</i> - Show in the frame or window named <i>name</i>. If a
 target named <i>name</i> does not already exist, a new top-level window with
 the specified name is created, and the document is shown there.</li>

 <a href="doc/wjhk/jupload2/policies/DefaultUploadPolicy.html" title="class in wjhk.jupload2.policies"><CODE>DefaultUploadPolicy</CODE></A></td>
 <td>This parameter is used by all policies. It allows the applet to change
 the current page to another one after a successful upload. <br>
 This allows, for instance, to display a page containing the file description
 of the newly uploaded page. Since version 3.0.2b2, you can specify a
 JavaScript expression instead of a plain URL. So afterUploadURL can now
 contain:<br>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>A javascript expression</B>: The URL must start by <I>javascript:</I>.
 See below for details.</LI>
 <LI><B>A http URL</B>: the navigator will open this URL, in the current
 page or another, according to the <I>afterUploadTarget</I> parameter. Any
 URL that doesn't start by <I>javascript:</I> is handled as an http URL.</LI>
 </UL>
 If the value of afterUploadURL starts with the string "javascript:", the
 remainder of the string is evaluated as JavaScript expression in the current
 document context. For example: If afterUloadURL is<br>
 <code>"javascript:alert('Thanks for the upload');"</code>,</br> then
 after a successful upload, a messagebox would pop up. Since 3.0.2b3 there are
 now three placeholders available which can be used as parameters in function
 calls:
 <ul>
 <li><code>%success%</code> is replaced by <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
 depending on upload success.
 <li><code>%msg%</code> is replaced by an unquoted string, containing the
 error message received from the server (if any). Inside that string, all
 occurances of the single-quote character (hex 27) are quoted by backslashes.
 <li><code>%body%</code> is replaced by an unquoted string, containing the
 complete response body. Inside that string, all occurances of the
 single-quote character (hex 27) are quoted by backslashes.
 </ul>
 So if you set afterUloadURL to <code>"alert('%body%');"</code>, then the
 resulting message box would show the body content of the last server
 response.</td>

 <td>This parameters defines the maximum size of an upload.
 <ul>
 <li>If not set, or set to a value of 0 or less, the chunk mode is disabled.
 That is: each file will be uploaded within being splitted in pieces.
 <li>If set to a value of 1 or more, the upload size will be never be more
 than maxChunkSize. A file bigger will be split in several part of
 <i>maxChunkSize</i> size, then the last part will contain the remaining, and
 will probably be smaller than <i>maxChunkSize</i>.
 </ul>
 <br>
 <b>How to build the server part:</b> the server will have to 'guess' that
 the file is splitted, and then it will have to reconstruct the uploaded file.
 Here are the necessary informations:
 <ul>
 <li>When a file is chunked, the <i>jupart</i> and <i>jufinal</i> parameter
 are given in the URL (get parameters). This identify a chunk upload. If these
 parameters are not given, the file(s) is(are) uploaded in one piece.
 <li><i>jupart</i> identify the part number: from 1 to N for a file being
 plitted in N pieces. The N-1 chunks should be <i>maxChunkSize</i> bytes
 long. The last one contains the remaining of the file.
 <li><i>jufinal</i> is set to 0 for chunks from 1 to N-1. It is is set to 1
 only for the last chunk (N, in this 'example').
 <li>The uploaded filename is not modified when the upload is chunked.
 Example: upload of the file <i>bigPicture.jpeg</i>, of 4,5 Mb, with chunk of
 2Mb. The upload is splitted in three chunk. Chunk 1 and 2 are 2Mb long. The
 third one is 0,5Mb long. The uploaded filename for these three uploads is
 <i>bigPicture.jpeg</i>. It's up to the server part to read the <i>jupart</i>
 and <i>jufinal</i> get parameters, to understand that the upload is chunked.
 <li><b>Important:</b> The server script <u>must</u> check the resulting
 filesize. If not, the client can send a file of any size, and fill the server
 hard drive.
 <li>The wwwroot/pages/parseRequest.jsp is a java example of a server page
 that can receive chunk upload. It stores each chunk is <i>filename.partN</i>
 (where N is the chunk number), then construct the final file, by
 concatenating all parts together.
 </ul>
 <b>Note: </b> If nbFilesPerRequest is different than 1, the applet will try
 to upload the files until the sum of their content length is less than
 maxChunkSize. The upload is triggered just before the sum of their content
 length is bigger then maxChunkSize.<br>
 If one file is bigger than <i>maxChunkSize</i>, all previous files are
 uploaded (at once or not, depending on nbFilesPerRequest). Then the 'big'
 file is uploaded alone, splitted in chunk. Then upload goes on, file by file
 or not, depending on <i>nbFilesPerRequest</i>. </td>

 <code>postURL</code>, the <i>same</i> same script receives the subsequent
 POST request(s). If this URL may change during the applet execution time, you

 UploadPolicy class and either :
 <ul>
 <li>Override the <a href="doc/wjhk/jupload2/policies/UploadPolicy.html#getPostURL()"><CODE>getPostURL()</CODE></A>

 ftp://username:password@myhost.com:21/directory<br>
 <u>Note 3:</u> in FTP, you'll have to add the jakarta-commons-oro.jar and
 jakarta-commons-net.jar jar files in the applet ARCHIVE tag attribute. See
 the 'advanced_js_demo.html page for a sample. You'll have to put the two
 files coming from the JUpload distribution in the same directory as the

 <td>With this parameter, the handling of certificates when using SSL can be
 configured. There are 4 possible settings:<br>
 <ul>
 <li><i>none</i> (default): Any server cert is accepted, no cert-based
 client authentication is performed.</li>
 <li><i>server</i>: The server cert is verified against the local truststore
 and if that fails, a dialog pops up which asks the user if the certificate
 shall be accepted permanently, just for the current session or not at all
 (Just like any browser would do).</li>
 <li><i>client</i>: A user-certificate (which must be available in the local
 keystore) is used to perform client authentication.</li>
 <li><i>strict</i>: The combination of <i>client</i> and <i>server</i>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The location of the local truststore and keystore uses the normal JRE
 conventions. This means, that the system truststore is used for verifying
 server certs (usually in $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts) unless either the
 system property <i>javax.net.ssl.trusStore</i> specifies another location or
 a file <b>.truststore</b> exists in the user's home directory. If the user
 decides to permanently accept an untrusted certificate, the file
 <b>.truststore</b> in the user's home directory is written. The default
 keystore (for client certificates) is the file <b>.keystore</b> in the
 user's home directory. This can be overridden by setting the system property
 <i>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</i>. If the name of the keystore ends in <b>.p12</b>,
 it is assumed that the keystore is in <b>PKCS12</b> format, otherwise the
 default format as specified in the JRE security-configuration is used.
 <p>
 <b>Important Note about client authentication:</b>
 <p>
 At the time of this writing, a <i>serious</i> bug exists in apache 2.0.x
 which prevents POST requests when SSL renegotiation is about to happen.
 Renegotiation is triggered by a location-based (or directory-based) change of
 the SSLVerifyClient directive in apache. Therefore you <b>can not</b>
 protect a sub-area of an otherwise unprotected SSL server. You can circumvent
 that by setting up a virtualhost which is configured to perform SSL client
 verification <b>for the complete virtualhost</b>. Attached to the bug report
 at <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12355">ASF
 Bugzilla</a>, there are several patches which claim to fix the problem.
 However in that same report, other users complain about those patches to be
 ineffective. Therefore, the author recommends avoiding re-negotiation
 alltogether by using the virtualhost aproach described above. It is the
 understanding of the author, that this bug has been fixed for apache 2.2,
 however the author did not verify that. Test-Reports from users running
 apache 2.2 are welcome.</td>

 are extracted as the error message. So, if the server response contains the

 error?", then the applet won't find any error in the server response.</td>

 The default test expression testes that the web server returns no HTTP error:
 200 is the return code for a successfull HTTP request. It actually means that
 postURL is a valid URL, and that the applet was able to send a request to
 this URL: there should be no problem with the network configuration, like
 proxy, password proxy...). <br>
 <b>But</b> it doesn't mean that the uploaded files have correctly be managed
 by the server. For instance, the URL can be http://sourceforge.net, which, of
 course, would not take your files into account. <br>
 So, as soon as you know a regular expression that test the return from the
 target application (and not just a techical HTTP response code), change the
 stringUploadSuccess to this value. For instance, the default value will be
 matched if the HTTP body content of the server response contains one line
 that is exactly 'SUCCESS', without any other character. This 'success' means
 that the pictures have correctly uploaded to the server, and that he
 successfully managed the uploaded files. </td>
